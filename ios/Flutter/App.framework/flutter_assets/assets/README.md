# CS490-Stockerino

My CS490 project using Dart and Flutter for cross platform building.

## What it does

The purpose of this app is to keep track of stocks that you choose. I am going to be leveraging the Investors Exchange (IEX) Trading API. This allows me to get a bunch of information about the stock market, as well as information regarding individual stocks.
